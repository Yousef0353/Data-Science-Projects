## Project 1:
### Webscrapping Danish largest Jobportal: **Jobindex**.

Wouldn't it just be easy if you could get a list of all the job postings you find interesting with a single click. Instead of having to go through 5-10 pages or maybe more? üßê

It is not the world's most advanced system, but a simple mini-project for a young student üë®‚Äçüéì

I have worked on webscraping the website Jobindex, which is why you can search for the desired area, keyword and number of pages. In addition, as a user, I would like to receive the following information:

* Title
* Company
* Date
* Job description
* Company location
* URL

It's a simple project, but has been incredibly educational, and see how you can automate something as practical as searching for job postings. I'm already looking forward to what my next project will be üí™
